                <p>The term "meme" was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book "The Selfish Gene," long before the internet as we know it existed. He described it as a "unit of cultural transmission"â€”an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. Little did he know how perfectly that term would describe the viral content of the digital age.</p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary pt-4 border-t border-gray-600">The Pre-Internet Era: Early Ancestors</h2>
                <p>Before GIFs and JPEGs, memes existed in other forms. Think of the "Kilroy Was Here" graffiti from World War II or the "Andre the Giant Has a Posse" sticker campaign. These were ideas that spread virally, carried not by bandwidth but by human hands.</p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary pt-4 border-t border-gray-600">The Early Internet (1990s): The Primordial Soup</h2>
                <p>The dawn of the public internet brought new ways for memes to spread. Early examples were often shared via email chains and Usenet forums:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong className="text-text-primary">The Dancing Baby (1996):</strong> One of the very first internet memes, this 3D animation of a baby dancing the cha-cha became a cultural phenomenon, even appearing on the TV show "Ally McBeal."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong className="text-text-primary">Hampster Dance (1998):</strong> A simple webpage featuring rows of animated hamsters dancing to a sped-up Roger Miller song. It was catchy, absurd, and endlessly shareable.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary pt-4 border-t border-gray-600">The Rise of Social Media (2000s-2010s): The Cambrian Explosion</h2>
                <p>Platforms like 4chan, Reddit, YouTube, and later Facebook and Twitter, became meme incubators. This era gave us the classic "image macro" format: a picture with bold, white Impact font text at the top and bottom. This is where meme culture truly exploded:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong className="text-text-primary">LOLcats ("I Can Has Cheezburger?"):</strong> Cute cat photos with funny, misspelled captions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong className="text-text-primary">Rickrolling:</strong> The ultimate bait-and-switch prank, tricking people into clicking a link that leads to Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong className="text-text-primary">Advice Animals:</strong> Character-based memes like Scumbag Steve, Good Guy Greg, and Socially Awkward Penguin, each with their own personality and theme.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary pt-4 border-t border-gray-600">The Modern Era (2020s): AI and Beyond</h2>
                <p>Today, meme culture moves faster than ever, fueled by platforms like TikTok and advanced creative tools. The latest frontier is AI-powered meme generation. Tools like ours at <NavLink to="/" className="text-primary hover:underline">FreeMemesGenerator.com</NavLink> allow anyone to create unique images, get caption ideas, and remix content with simple text prompts.
