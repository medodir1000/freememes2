                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong className="text-text-primary">Tap into Trends:</strong> Is there a new movie, TV show, or event everyone is talking about? Memes about current events often get a lot of traction quickly. Keep an eye on what's trending and think about how you can put a funny spin on it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong className="text-text-primary">Be Highly Relatable:</strong> Create memes about shared experiences. Think about work-from-home struggles, student life, dating, or funny things pets do. The more people who say "that's so me," the more votes you'll get.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong className="text-text-primary">Master the Punchline:</strong> A great meme is like a great joke. The top text often sets up a situation, and the bottom text delivers the punchline. Make it unexpected and witty.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong className="text-text-primary">Use High-Quality Images:</strong> Whether you're using a template or generating an image with AI, make sure it's clear and not pixelated. A clean look makes your meme more appealing.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Creating the meme is only half the battle. Now you need to get eyes on it!</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong className="text-text-primary">Share, Share, Share:</strong> Use the built-in share buttons on your meme card. Don't be shy! Post it on your Facebook, share it in WhatsApp groups, and pin it on Pinterest.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong className="text-text-primary">Know Your Audience:</strong> Share your meme where it will be appreciated. If you made a gaming meme, share it in gaming communities (where allowed). If it's a programming joke, share it with your developer friends.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong className="text-text-primary">Ask for Votes (Nicely):</strong> When you share your meme, there's nothing wrong with saying, "Hey, check out my new meme! If you like it, please give it a vote to help me win the monthly contest!"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong className="text-text-primary">Engage with Comments:</strong> When people comment on your meme, reply to them! Building a little community around your post can encourage more people to engage and vote.

                </ul>
