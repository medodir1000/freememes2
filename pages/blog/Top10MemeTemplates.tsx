                    <p className="mt-2">A brilliant combination of two unrelated images: a screenshot of a distraught reality TV star and a photo of a confused-looking white cat sitting at a dinner table. It perfectly captures the dynamic of a one-sided, irrational argument.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div className="pt-4 border-t border-gray-600">

                    <p className="mt-2">Featuring political commentator Steven Crowder at a table with a sign that reads "Male Privilege is a Myth | Change My Mind." The template is used to present a controversial or funny opinion, daring the internet to challenge it.</p>

                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary">8. Two Buttons</h2>
                    <p className="mt-2">A stock photo of a person sweating profusely while trying to decide between two big red buttons. It represents any difficult or stressful decision, especially when both options are tempting or terrible.</p>

                    <p className="mt-2">A low-resolution screenshot of Pikachu from the Pok√©mon anime with his mouth agape. It's the perfect reaction for a situation where a completely obvious outcome occurs, yet you still act shocked.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="pt-4 border-t border-gray-600">

                    <p className="mt-2">A multi-panel meme that shows increasingly absurd or "enlightened" ways of thinking about a simple concept, culminating in a glowing, cosmic brain. It's a sarcastic take on intellectualism.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="pt-4 border-t border-gray-600">
                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary">4. One Does Not Simply Walk into Mordor</h2>
                    <p className="mt-2">Featuring Boromir from "The Lord of the Rings," this classic image macro is used to describe any task that is far more difficult than it sounds. A true veteran of the meme wars.</p>

                <div className="pt-4 border-t border-gray-600">

                    <p className="mt-2">A stock photo model whose pained, forced smile perfectly captures the feeling of trying to stay positive while enduring internal suffering. Harold is the face of quiet desperation everywhere.</p>

                <div className="pt-4 border-t border-gray-600">

                    <p className="mt-2">A two-panel image of the rapper Drake, looking displeased in the first panel and approving in the second. It's a simple, versatile format for showing preference for one thing over another.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="pt-4 border-t border-gray-600">
                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-text-primary">1. Distracted Boyfriend</h2>
