                 <p>Static images are great, but short, looping videos can be even funnier. Our AI Video Generator lets you describe a short scene and creates an animated clip for you. A "dog skateboarding" becomes much funnier when you can actually see it happen. This is a cutting-edge feature that can help your meme stand out from the crowd.</p>
